# ChatBot
Developed an interactive AI Chatbot using Java as part of my internship at CodeAlpha. The chatbot is capable of engaging in basic conversations, responding to user queries, and simulating real-time interaction.  Implemented using Java (OOP concepts) with conditional statements for response handling.
